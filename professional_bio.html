      <h1>Professional Bio</h1>

      <section>
        <p>I am seeking opportunities to grow and expand upon the experience
          I’ve gained from being part of a local company in the Philadelphia
          suburbs, and apply it to a larger, metropolitan company. New York has
          a broader market where my work could have a larger impact,
          potentially even internationally. In addition to career growth
          potential in New York, I have always been inspired by the art and
          culture of the city. I’ve always been drawn to urban settings, so
          attending The Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. was a
          great fit. I was able to experience the city while enjoying the
          success and team culture of their field hockey team. At Catholic, I
          pursued a degree with limitless application in my personal and
          professional life, Psychology.</p>

        <p>After graduation, I moved back to my hometown of West Chester, PA,
          and applied my degree to a Social Media and Marketing position for a
          local company, where I spearheaded the marketing and branding
          efforts, working closely with the CEO to maintain his vision. I
          continued honing my keen eye for aesthetics and design and explored
          more creative avenues within the organization. Though originally
          focused on social media, I quickly expanded my position
          responsibilities to include other creative marketing endeavors. I
          applied my existing photography and Photoshop knowledge and learned
          Illustrator and InDesign to provide in-house digital design. In an
          effort to continually expand and improve my capabilities, I enrolled
          in courses in front end web development. After completing free HTML
          and CSS classes, I enrolled in an intensive bootcamp “Build Websites
          from Scratch”. After months of dedication, I received a grade of
          “Exceeded Expectations”, the highest mark possible in the class. I've
          utilized all these skills and have expanded the scope of my position
          at the company.</p>

        <p>Directly reporting to the owner of this organization has groomed me
          for future leadership positions. The owner mentored and tasked me
          with managing all the marketing, branding and public relations for
          the company. My leadership training extended beyond the company; I
          represented the company as the professional community leader, often
          managing events with non-profit organizations and professional
          groups. The experience I’ve gained in marketing, branding, graphic
          design and web development along with the direct view into the
          management of an organization has enabled me to shape my next role.</p>

        <p>When not working, I spend my time enjoying athletics and art. I was
          introduced to field hockey at a young age, and decided to play
          year-round. I still play year-round in a competitive adult league,
          and love getting to know my new teammates and the challenge each new
          opponent brings. On weekends in the winter, I can usually be found
          shredding up the slopes on my snowboard with my family. I unwind
          through a variety of creative outlets. I typically prefer the mystery
          and depth-of-field of black and white film photography, but with
          sporadic access to a darkroom, I started practicing digital
          photography in more recent years. In my photography, I gravitate
          towards fashion and portraits, which may be a personal bias given
          another hobby of mine, sewing. For me, sewing is more of a puzzle
          than an art. Once I learned the basics I could look at a garment and
          know the individual pieces of the pattern. Occasionally I have made
          my own patterns for costumes. One day, I would like to take classes
          to learn couture techniques. My love of visuals and fashion extends
          beyond what the eye can initially see, I also like to create my own
          vision through watercolor paintings. I try to keep my life and mind
          as balanced as possible with my competitive pursuits and my creative
          outlets.</p>
